# EmbarkLocal

A website that helps travelers make authentic and meaningful connections with locals by matching them with hosts based on shared interests. This project was built as part of the 2023 HackSC hackathon.

The motivation behind this project is to provide travelers with a platform to connect with locals in a way that goes beyond traditional tourist experiences. By matching travelers with hosts based on shared interests, we aim to create authentic and meaningful connections that allow travelers to truly immerse themselves in the local culture. Whether it's trying new food, learning a new skill, or just hanging out with locals, our goal is to make travel more memorable and impactful.
