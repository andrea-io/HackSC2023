        <p>"Peepee Poopoo" - John</p>
        <p>"I've always loved cooking and was so excited to find a ConnectLocal host who could teach me how to make pasta 
            from scratch. The experience was truly unforgettable - not only did I learn how to make delicious pasta, but I 
            also got to share a meal and conversation with my host and other travelers. It was such a unique and intimate way 
            to get to know the local culture and traditions. I highly recommend ConnectLocal to any traveler who wants to have 
            an authentic and meaningful travel experience. The connections I made with my host and the other travelers will stay 
            with me forever." - Sarah </p>

            "I was hesitant about trying a new way of traveling, but I'm so glad I gave ConnectLocal a chance. My host
            was an amazing guide and showed me parts of the city I never would have discovered on my own. We bonded
            over our shared love of art and history and I felt like I was experiencing the city with a local
            friend. The experience was truly unforgettable and made my trip so much more meaningful. I can't
            recommend ConnectLocal enough to anyone who wants to have a unique and authentic travel experience." - Melissa
